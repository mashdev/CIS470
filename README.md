# CIS470 Senior Project

Moved senior project to repo to demonstrate my work. 

The senior (group) project was like many that I had been told of by colleagues who had already graduated where the group starts off strong and as the project nears the completion date the others who did not understand how the project was supposed to be put together struggled. To be fair and give credit where it is due, the other team mates did create the outline, project requirement, work flow, and uml documents which was due within the first 4 weeks for an 8 week course. 

When it came down to the actual coding only one team mate stepped up and created the database and tables but no one else took ownership or volunteered to do any of the programming. I ended up taking ownership of the coding and built the project from the ground up and taking it down to the wire which ended on a 20 hour code sprint to the finish.

I absolutely refused to not pass the senior project class and made it a point to get an "A" in the class which the team was able to benefit from. Why am I including this in the README you ask? It is to show that I love to program and have the "Do Not Give Up" attitude when it comes to developing solutions.

Enough with my senior project horror story..

Here is a quick over view of the requirements for the project:
The made up company WSC is wanting to have a website developed that would allow them to display their inventory and then allow customers to purchase them via the site. The requirements needed for the customers are: customer registration, customer log in/log out, customer profile, and purchase history. The company user requirements are:  admin log in/log out, orders received dashboard, orders pending, and orders completed.

The website was to be built with C# and ASP.Net as the underlying framework.

The solution file to start the project is in the root of the repo and the rest of the project files are in the WSC1 folder.
